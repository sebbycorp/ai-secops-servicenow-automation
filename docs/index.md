# AI-Assisted ServiceNow Security Operations

## Project Overview

This project implements an AI-powered workflow that connects ServiceNow ticket management with security operations, enabling voice-controlled management of security changes.

{% include_relative workflow_diagram.md %}

## How It Works

The system allows security operations engineers to:

1. **Voice-Query Tickets**: Ask "Do I have any tickets in my ServiceNow queue?"
2. **Review Changes**: Have AI explain complex firewall/load balancer changes in plain English
3. **Voice-Approve**: Verbally approve changes after review
4. **Automated Implementation**: Changes automatically applied to network infrastructure
5. **Documentation**: All changes automatically documented in GitHub and Confluence

## Key Components

- **Voice Interface**: Natural language processing for security operations
- **ServiceNow Integration**: Bidirectional communication with ServiceNow APIs
- **AI Translation Layer**: Converts technical network changes to plain language
- **MCP Service**: Managed Change Process for secure implementation
- **Documentation Automation**: Updates repositories and knowledge bases

## Benefits

- **Reduced Manual Effort**: Eliminates repetitive documentation and implementation tasks
- **Improved Security**: Maintains human oversight while automating implementation
- **Better Communication**: Bridges the gap between technical details and business context
- **Complete Audit Trail**: All changes logged with approver information
- **Consistent Implementation**: Standardized change process across the organization

## Architecture

The system uses a modular architecture with the following components:

1. **Voice Interface Layer**: Processes speech and delivers responses
2. **AI Processing Layer**: Claude AI for intent recognition and language processing
3. **ServiceNow Connector**: API integration with ServiceNow
4. **Security Change Implementation**: Secure access to network devices
5. **Documentation Gateway**: Interfaces with GitHub and Confluence

## Implementation Examples

### Voice Query
```
User: "Do I have any tickets in my ServiceNow queue?"
AI: "You have 3 tickets in your queue. Here they are: Ticket CHG0010234: Update firewall rules for new marketing application..."
```

### Ticket Description
```
User: "Tell me about ticket CHG0010234"
AI: "Ticket CHG0010234 is a request to update firewall rules. All prerequisite tasks are complete. This change will allow web traffic from the new marketing application server at 10.2.3.4 to access the customer database on port 3306."
```

### Approval
```
User: "I approve the change for ticket CHG0010234"
AI: "Change approved. I'll implement the firewall updates and notify the team when complete."
```
